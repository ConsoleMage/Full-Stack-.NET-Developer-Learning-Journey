# Full-Stack-.NET-Developer-Learning-Journey

This is an internal training program that is conducted in-house by experienced trainers. At the end of the 4-month course, an internal certificate will be awarded upon completion of all tasks, quizzes and exams.

I created this repository to track my own learning and to explore GitHub's many features and tools for developers. Have fun :)
